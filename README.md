# Skedula
Skedula is an Electron based desktop application for scheduling appointment in a Hospital. Skedula is designed to be a patient appointment scheduler which works in both online and offline mode (wherein the patient receives his/her appointment via the receptionist). 
The application caters to the following needs â€“
* Allows patients to schedule an appointment with the doctor/physician of their choice.
* Provides the physician the ability to retrieve details of the patients (history of medical reports).
* Enables the patient to view their medical records and prescribed medicines all within a click of a button. 
* In addition, doctors will also have full access to his/her schedule and the rights to modify it according to their availability. It aims to serve as platform that can bridge the communication gap between the hospital and its patients.

The database used is  MySQL running on the Apache web sever. 

## Database Design:

### The Relational database model has the following tables:
* Doctor (DocID, pwd, f_name, s_name, Specialization, start time, end time, max today)   
* Receptionist (RID, pwd, f_name, s_name)  
* Patient (PatID, pwd, f_name, s_name, Addr_Line1, Addr_Line2) 
* Patient_mobile (PatID, mobile number)  
* Schedule (sID, Start time, PatID, DocID)  
* Doc_Sch (sID, DocID, Doc Report path)  
* Admin (aID, f_name, s_name)  
* AdminManipulate(aID, M_ID)  
M_ID values are DocID or PatID or RID
